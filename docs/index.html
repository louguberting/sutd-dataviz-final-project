		<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
		<h2>Lou Guberti-Ng</h2>

			For decades, children and adults of all ages have been clicking and clacking Lego bricks into iconic designs
			and new creations from their wildest imaginations. I can trace so many of the moments of my life with Lego.
			If I close my eyes, I can be in my old living room in 1994, my grandfather watching Bob Ross painting happy
			trees and me plugging away at <a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/6076-1/dark-dragons-den/#comments"
				target="_blank">6076 Dark Dragon’s Den</a>. It’s 1996, I’m watching the neighbor intently piece together
			<a href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/6090-1/royal-knights-castle/#comments" target="_blank">6090 Royal
				Knight's Castle</a>.

			Blink again and my brother and I are tearing through every set from 2005’s Star Wars Revenge of the Sith
			release. It’s 2019 and after nearly doubling my salary with my first Salesforce job the new <a
				href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/75218-1/x-wing-starfighter/#comments" target="_blank">75218 X-Wing
				Starfighter</a> is a fitting reward. It’s two days ago, I’m explaining to my son why he simply
			<b><i>can’t</i></b> tear the back doors off the <a
				href="https://rebrickable.com/sets/10497-1/galaxy-explorer/#comments" target="_blank">10497 Galaxy
				Explorer</a> I spent over 5 hours on.
		</p>

			With so many years of sets composed of so many different types of pieces and colors, I thought that Lego
			would be a great place to turn for the Final Project for this class. As a fan for over thirty years, I’ve
			seen the shifts in the sets Lego produces. With the passing years, the variety of colors and types of pieces
			have exploded. Sets were previously themed with generic characters like Knights, Pirates or different Space
			factions of Lego’s own creation. The last 20 years have seen an almost total takeover of licensed sets with
			themes such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel and numerous others. I have some ambivalence about this
			trend. Sure, growing up I was always trying to turn my store bought sets into X-Wings and TIE Fighters. But
			does it stunt a child's creativity to have everything served up to them prepackaged? I want to explore these
			changes in my project; showing the different trends using fun, playful interactive visualizations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any Lego lover will tell you that having sorted and organized parts will set you up for success in building
			your own creation. For data visualization the process is no different. I’m fortunate to have an excellent
			data source to start from in the site <a href="https://rebrickable.com/home/"
				target="_blank">Rebrickable</a>. Touting itself as a site to “easily find official or custom sets you
			can build using your existing LEGO sets”, Rebrickable has an extensive <a
				href="https://rebrickable.com/downloads/" target="_blank">database of sets, parts, colors, and
				themes</a> across Lego’s long history which it makes freely available. These data tables have primary
			keys to make joining them together simple. The colors table includes hex codes which could lend themselves
			to some really fun visualizations like a comparison of the top colors over time. I can enrich the theme
			table by categorizing them by license and join it to the sets table to show the shift into licensed sets in
			the 2000s. My plan is to work with the data tables locally on my computer and pre-aggregate it for use in my
			visualizations. The work is a bit daunting since the inventory_parts table which contains the list of pieces
			in each set has 120 MBs of data making initial exploration more difficult. I’m excited to work through that
			data with Python and really test my abilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, Rebrickable has a <a href="https://rebrickable.com/api/" target="_blank">REST API</a> that
			developers can use to access their data tables. This API is rate limited however to protect against
			malicious bulk downloads of the data. I’d love to build a search tool on my project page that allows a user
			to search for a set and produce a tree map of the colors used in that set. This tool would be delightful to
			use and allow my project to include real time data.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe this project will support my learning goals and challenge me to create great looking
			visualizations. While in the past I’ve used tools like Microsoft Excel, SQL and Tableau to make
			visualizations this will be my first time using Javascript. The Python scripting for the project will be a
			significant step up from the earlier work I’ve done in programming classes at SUTD. I’m excited to stretch
			my skills and share my passion for Lego with this work.
